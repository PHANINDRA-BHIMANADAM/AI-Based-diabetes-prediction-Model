"AI-powered medical diagnosis for diabetes prediction using machine learning"

# AI-Powered Medical Diagnosis (Diabetes Prediction)

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients using machine learning. By analyzing key health parameters such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI, the model helps in early diagnosis and preventive care.

## Problem Statement
Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective management. Traditional methods require laboratory tests, but an AI-driven approach can assist in rapid preliminary screening using readily available health metrics.

## Solution
We have implemented a machine learning model using a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict diabetes based on a dataset of medical records. The model processes patient data, performs feature scaling, and provides an easy-to-use prediction function.

## Tools & Platforms Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, Google Colab (for execution)
- **Machine Learning Model:** Random Forest Classifier
- **Dataset:** PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset

## Obtained Output
- **Model Accuracy:** 73%
- **Classification Report:**
